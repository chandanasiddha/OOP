Abstraction simplifies complex systems by focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

It's like keeping sensitive documents locked in a safe—only authorized people (or methods, in programming terms) should be able to access or modify them. Encapsulation helps maintain integrity and security by bundling data and the methods that operate on it within a single unit (typically a class) and controlling access through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n"
